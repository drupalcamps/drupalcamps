# DrupalCamps

This goal of this project is to become a centralized and definitive resource for DrupalCamp statistics, dates, and other helpful information for both organizers and sponsors. Ultimately, one outcome of this project will be to help provide best practices around camp attendance metrics, top-level financial information, and event planning processes.
